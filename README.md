###### It is known that third party clients (such as this) and modifications to the official client are **against terms of service.** However, Discord staff have on multiple occasions stated they do not actively seek out users for using such clients/mods. Regardless, if for what ever reason you are punished for using this client, **I am not responsible**. Use at your own risk!
